    <p>I am beyond excited that you are here!</p>

    <p>Currently, I am a student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology studying Computer Science. Yes, I enjoy learning
      about software and how computers work, but there are many more areas of life that I am passionate about and if we
      ever have the pleasure of meeting, I will gladly tell you about all of it! I love discussing ideas!!!</p>

    <p>One of my driving passions is telling stories. Whether it's through making videos, taking photos, designing a
      website, writing, you name it, telling a story brings me so much joy! There is a story behind everything from
      making breakfast in the morning to a project you have worked on for your entire life, from a stranger you saw in a
      coffee shop to a lifelong friend or family member. Regardless, I want to tell it!</p>

    <p>Above all, what drives me is my relationship with and trust in Christ. If you are to know anything about me, you
      should know that I am Catholic. I believe that we are all created with a purpose and while I don't know completely
      what my purpose is, I strive to tell the story that has been created by the One who created it all and depict the
      beauty of creation in any way that I can. My faith in God is the foundation of all that I do and the reason I do
      it. None of it would be possible without it.</p>

    <p>If you are even remotely interested in telling your story or even just getting to know me, I would love to talk!
      Let's tell your story together!â€‹</p>
